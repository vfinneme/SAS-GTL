## AVAL_CHG
This template creates a combination box/scatter plot for AVAL at two visits for each treatment group (typically baseline/entry and follow-up) side by side with CHG between those two visits.

### Notes
- Colors defined within this template are based on color pallete macro variables leveraged in our main codes
